      "\n",
      "**If you're practical and appreciate usefulness:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **A high-quality version of something you use often:** Maybe a really nice leather wallet to replace your worn-out one, a comfortable and stylish backpack for your commute, or a subscription to a streaming service you love.\n",
      "*   **A tool or gadget related to your hobbies:** If you're into cooking, a fancy chef's knife or a sous vide machine. If you're a gamer, a new headset or a cool controller. If you're into photography, a new lens or a photography course.\n",
      "*   **A personalized item:** A custom-engraved keychain with a special date or inside joke, a framed print of your favorite place, or a mug with a funny quote that reminds me of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you're sentimental and appreciate experiences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **A handwritten letter or card:** Sometimes, the most meaningful gift is simply expressing my feelings for you in words.\n",
      "*   **A photo album or scrapbook filled with memories:** I'd gather our favorite photos and write captions about the special moments we've shared.\n",
      "*   **A \"date night\" basket:** Filled with things like a cozy blanket, a bottle of wine, your favorite snacks, and a movie we can watch together.\n",
      "*   **Tickets to an event you'd love:** A concert by your favorite band, a sporting event, a comedy show, or a weekend getaway.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you're into self-care and relaxation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **A massage or spa day:** A chance for you to unwind and de-stress.\n",
      "*   **A curated gift box with grooming products:** High-quality shaving cream, beard oil, or cologne.\n",
      "*   **A cozy robe and slippers:** Perfect for relaxing at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "**No matter what I choose, I'd make sure it comes from the heart and shows you how much I care about you.**\n",
